HOSTHenrik Bjarke Vægter is an internationally leading researcher in the field of pain, exercise and pro- and anti-
nociceptive mechanisms. His primary research expertise lies within pain, physical activity, and interdisciplinary
rehabilitation with a particular focus on quantitative assessment of pro- and anti-nociceptive mechanisms in
individuals with chronic pain to understand how these manifestations influence outcomes after rehabilitation.

Henrik Bjarke Vægter is Head of the interdisciplinary Pain Research Group at University Hospital Odense and he has
extensive experience in working in interdisciplinary teams and networks nationally and internationally within this
area. He is leading several large scale externally funded projects and randomized controlled trials in clinical
practice.

Henrik has published extensively within the field of pain and exercise, and is author of 70 publications in
international peer-reviewed journals (2/3 as first or senior author) with several papers published in the top five
journals in the pain and exercise field (e.g. PAIN, Journal of Pain, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise).
His H-index is 22 (Google Scholar).

Henrik has led the development and implementation of 2 electronic clinical registries (PainData and FunkData)
including patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures across more than 20 private and public interdisciplinary
rehabilitation centers in Denmark, and is now leading the steering group for development of quality indicators in
interdisciplinary pain management in Denmark comprising multiple professional disciplines (center leaders,
physicians, nurses, psychologist, physiotherapists, secretaries and patient-representatives). Furthermore, he has
a strong collaboration with Danish Regions where he is part of the implementation group for the project Value-
Based Health Care in high-impact chronic pain.

Henrik is associate editor for Scand J Pain since 2020 and perform numerous ad-hoc reviews for scientific journals,
including frequent reviews for top journals within the pain field. He has served as grant reviewer for organizations
such as Medical Research Council, UK, Research Council Norway, Auckland Medical Research Foundation in New
Zealand and Israel Science Foundation.

Henrik Bjarke Vægter has received research support as the principal investigator or co-applicant from numerous
sources including The philanthropic foundation TrygFonden, HelseFonden, Offerfonden, Sundheds- og
Ældreministeriet, The Danish Rheumatism Association, Udviklings- og Forskningspuljen, and The Fund for
Physiotherapy in Private Practice.

Henrik has a comprehensive teaching portfolio including formal education (Lecturer Training Programme, SDU)
and supervision of master’s students, PhD students and postdocs as well as formal educational training in research
leadership and management (Project Management and Leadership for researchers at RUC and SDU). He has
served as PhD opponent in Denmark and Australia.
